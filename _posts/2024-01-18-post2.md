I've started thinking about 'tracking my macros' using an app. It's interesting thinking more carefully about what I eat. I've always been a bit of an intuitive eater, bit of a vegetarian eater (this requires thinking more about protein intake). I've been exercising almost daily for a while now - tracking things, which definitely helps me remaining consistent.
