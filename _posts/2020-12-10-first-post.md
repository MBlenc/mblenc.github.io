Žižek talks about a pathologically jealous husband:
> Recall, again, Lacan's outrageous statements that, even if what a jealous husband claims about his wife (that she sleeps around with other men) is all true, his jealousy is still pathological. Along the same lines, one could say that, even if most of the Nazi claims about the Jews were true (they exploit Germans, they seduce German girls), their anti-Semitism would still be (and was) pathological - because it represses the true reason the Nazis needed anti-Semitism in order to sustain their ideological position. So, in the case of anti-Semitism, knowledge about what the Jews "really are" is a fake, irrelevant, while the only knowledge at the place of truth is the knowledge about why a Nazi needs a figure of the Jew to sustain his ideological edifice. In this precise sense, the analyst's discourse produces the master signifier, the swerve of the patient's knowledge, the surplus element that situates the patient's knowledge at the level of truth: after the master signifier is produced, even if nothing changes at the level of knowledge, the same knowledge as before starts to function in a different mode. The master signifier is the unconscious sinthome, the cipher of enjoyment, to which the subject was unknowingly subjected.

It reminds me of some of this:
> By “feelings of inferiority” we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum of related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self-hatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) and that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.

Which is crazy Ted talking in some sort of Nietzschean way about "leftist morality" (what Nietzsche would call "slave morality")

I think this idea of oversocialization is an interesting take on Nietzsche's slave morality. What I'm getting at here is the idea that just because you're morally correct, doesn't mean that what got you there was a robust and generalizable system, this also concerns the distinction between ethics and morality.

This video I think relates somewhat to oversocialization:

Again Zizek talks about this in Less than nothing:
> Friedrich Nietzsche (a great admirer of Carmen) was the great philosopher of immoral ethics, and we should always remember that the title of Nietzsche’s masterpiece is “genealogy of morals,” not “of ethics”: the two are not the same. Morality is concerned with the symmetry of my relations to other humans; its zero‐level rule is “do not do to me what you do not want me to do to you.” Ethics, in contrast, deals with my consistency in relation to myself, my fidelity to my own desire. (Žižek, 2012, p. 124)
